// create an event listener for the divs

// when clicked it should create a circle inside with a certain color

//make it so that the colors alternate (perhaps you could use turn counter even/odd)

// the game will run until the winning conditions are met or no moves are left

// populate a message somewhere when a win condition is met or no moves are left for a draw

// the hard part is creating the win condiitons
// you could use an array or some sort of data grid to assign the div class numbers and create win conditions based off the location
// connect 4 is magnitudes more complex than ticTacToe due to a large increase in area of the box (from 9 to 42 total)
// if you could find some logic that is not location based it may be easier
